## Frontend Development

A Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend using Vuetify is located in the `frontend/` directory. It is built with Vite.

```bash
# install Node dependencies (requires Node.js and npm)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # start development server
npm run build       # build for production
```

The compiled files can be served by the FastAPI backend by copying the build output into the `static` directory.
